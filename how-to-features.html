  <h1>How to Decide on Your OnStage Robotic Features</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the thrilling world of OnStage robotic performances! If you're gearing up for a show that features dancing robotic dogs (say some yellow robotic dogs from Boston Dynamics), you're in for an exciting challenge. Here’s a guide on how to choose the top robotic features to dazzle the judges and the audience alike.</p>

  <h2>Understanding Robotic Features</h2>
  <p>Firstly, let’s clarify what constitutes a "feature" in an OnStage robotic performance. Features are the demonstrable capabilities of your robots that can be clearly showcased in your performance. These are not just the technical components or sensors, but the actions your robots can perform.</p>
  <p>A feature is something your robot can <b>do</b> because of its design, coding, and sensors. So for your performance with your good friend Spot, how would you go about choosing your features?</p>

  <h2>Examples of What Your Robots Can Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Move</b> in various styles such as dancing, trotting, running, and walking on different surfaces</li>
    <li><b>Pick up objects</b> with an arm or mouth acting as a gripper</li>
    <li><b>Avoid obstacles</b> like objects, humans, and other spots</li>
    <li><b>Balance</b> and stand up on two legs</li>
    <li><b>Navigate autonomously</b></li>
    <li><b>Detect and recognize</b> objects, sounds, and people</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Turning Actions into Features</h2>
  <p>Here are some cool ways to show what your robots can do:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Dancing Together:</b> The robot dogs dance in sync with the music</li>
    <li><b>Avoiding Collisions:</b> They cleverly avoid each other while moving</li>
    <li><b>Personal Tricks:</b> Each robot recognizes different people and performs a unique trick for them</li>
    <li><b>Listening to Voice Commands:</b> They change direction when hearing voice commands</li>
    <li><b>Following Gestures:</b> They perform actions in response to hand signals</li>
    <li><b>Moving Objects:</b> They can pick up and move objects to specific places</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Choose Your Features</h2>
  <p>When deciding which features to show, think about:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>What the Judges can easily look for:</b> Choose features that will play an important part of your performance - if the judges can’t see your feature in action, you can’t be scored</li>
    <li><b>Your Best Work:</b> Pick features you are most proud of</li>
    <li><b>What Shows Best:</b> Choose features that look great in your performance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Presenting Your Features</h2>
  <p>Make sure your video, poster, and interview clearly show and explain these features. This makes your performance stand out and helps the audience and judges look out for your features in action!</p>

  <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
  <p>Don’t focus on things like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Just a sensor (like "a light sensor")</li>
    <li>A simple algorithm</li>
    <li>Basic parts (like "omni-wheels" or “lego”)</li>
    <li>Communication methods (like "Bluetooth")</li>
    <li>Broad technologies without a specific use (like "vision recognition")</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Selecting the right features for your robots in an OnStage performance involves understanding their capabilities, transforming these into show-worthy features, and focusing on what you can best demonstrate. Follow this guide to ensure your robotic performers steal the show!</p>

Contribute to this page
=======================

This page is supposed to be a collection of resources for everyone involved in a OnStage competition.

If you are either organizing, running or participating in a OnStage competition and want to share your knowledge with others you are very welcome to contribute to this page.

Contribute through GitHub Pull requests
---------------------------------------

The most convenient way to contribute is to directly suggest your changes to the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/robocup-junior/onstage>`__, that stores this page.

All pages are created using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__ and `reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`__
which is very easy to read and write.

Follow these instructions on how to `Contributing to the project <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project>`__.

Other ways to contribute
------------------------

If you are not familiar with the usage of GitHub and reStructuredText we are also happy to accept all contributions in any other format. Please share them with us,
by sending an E-Mail to :email:`robocupjunior-onstage@robocup.org`.
